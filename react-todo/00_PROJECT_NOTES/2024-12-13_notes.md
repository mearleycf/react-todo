# (1) Project Notes - 2024-12-13

## (1.1) Manual Development Questions and Analysis

### (1.1.1) Required Clarifications

#### (1.1.1.1) Role Clarity

##### (1.1.1.1.1) AI Question

1. Are there specific actions that ONLY the Factory Owner can perform?
2. Are there specific actions that ONLY the Foreman can perform?
3. What are the shared responsibilities, if any?

##### (1.1.1.1.2) Human Answer

1. Honestly? I don't know, because I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I don't know how to use the system, which is why we're creating this document in the first place.
2. Same answer as 1
3. Same answer as 1

#### (1.1.1.2) Project Initialization

##### (1.1.1.2.1) AI Question

1. What is the exact process for starting a new project?
2. What files need to be created/modified?
3. What initial content is required?

##### (1.1.1.2.2) Human Answer

1. I don't know. I'm asking you to help me understand the system, so I don't have a clear idea of what the process should be.
2. Same answer as 1
3. Same answer as 1

#### (1.1.1.3) System Configuration

##### (1.1.1.3.1) AI Question

1. Are there any specific setup steps needed for the Factory system itself?
2. Are there configuration files that need to be modified?
3. Are there any prerequisites that need to be installed/configured?

##### (1.1.1.3.2) Human Answer

1. Honestly? I don't know, because I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I don't know how to use the system, which is why we're creating this document in the first place.
2. Same answer as 1
3. Same answer as 1

#### (1.1.1.4) Documentation Structure

##### (1.1.1.4.1) AI Question

1. Should we separate Owner vs. Foreman responsibilities into different sections?
2. Should we include specific command/instruction examples for interacting with the Foreman?
3. Would you prefer a task-based structure ("How to...") versus the current conceptual structure?

##### (1.1.1.4.2) Human Answer

1. I think that's a good idea.
2. Yes, that's also a good idea.
3. So, the answer is a bit complicated, right? This should follow standard system/framework documentation structure. There's probably a getting started guide, a reference guide that explains all of the system's components, and a user manual that explains how to use the system. So the [[01_GETTING_STARTED]] file is the getting started guide.

#### (1.1.1.5) Integration Points

##### (1.1.1.5.1) AI Question

1. How exactly does the Factory Owner communicate requirements to the Foreman?
2. What are the expected inputs and outputs at each workbench?
3. What feedback mechanisms exist between Owner and Foreman?

##### (1.1.1.5.2) Human Answer

1. I don't know. Really it's the same question you've been asking above, in different formats.
2. Same answer as 1
3. Same answer as 1

| Documentation Links | Basic internal links to files                  | Missing context and purpose for each link | Add descriptions of what each linked file contains and why it's relevant | Agreed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Process Flow        | Linear progression through workbenches         | Doesn't explain interaction model         | Add interaction diagrams and communication examples                      | This should also include who is performing the steps in the interaction/process flow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Setup Instructions  | Vague initial setup steps                      | No concrete getting started path          | Create step-by-step setup guide with verification steps                  | Correct--it needs to be a clear getting started guide for the Factory Owner to understand how to initialize the system and get started communicating and interacting with the Foreman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Tool Usage          | Generic "familiarize with tools"               | No specific tool guidance                 | Add tool catalog with usage examples                                     | Agreed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Project Management  | Vague status board reference                   | No project creation guidance              | Add project lifecycle documentation                                      | Agreed. Somewhere we also need to explain what the Owner needs to do to create a project. At some point in the getting started guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Version Control     | Basic version tracking                         | Missing workflow context                  | Add version control workflow with examples                               | Well, the version control section is the one section that isn't part of the owner's learning process--it's simply what it is--version control of the actual document itself--just like all of our other documents, we should track changes. etc. This means you also need to update the decisions_and_changes_log.md file to contain this new folder, this new file and other files we add, and then start adding content re: decisions and changes, just like we do for everything else. |

### (1.1.3) Previous Implementation Rationale

1. I focused on system structure over user interaction
1. (Owner): Right, the system structure already exists--it's the rest of the factory. We need to focus on human content, and human<->ai interaction, two way.
1. I assumed knowledge of the system's operation
1. This is honestly the biggest problem I have, and where I'm struggling. I got this concept of a factory framework for agentic AI interaction on development projects from another person. His process/factory system, as he showed it, is actually contained in the ./00_META/factory-knowledge-transfer.md document, as a series of images. So part of why I'm working with you, the AI, is to build that system out for my use. And part of why I'm working with you, the AI is to gain understanding of how to use it. It's kind of like this other person gave me all of the parts for a computer--motherboard, CPU, case, GPU, memory, hard drive, keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc--but didn't give me instructions on how to build it, or how to use it once it's built. So you and I are trying to take all of these parts and build/use it. So the Owner is the computer user, and he interacts with the computer (you) using the mouse, monitor, and keyboard. And then you, the computer, have various tools as well. You have memory, which is things that are active in your processing--I assume it's things like the toolbox, the whiteboard, the factory floor?, stuff like that. You have a CPU, which is things like the AI routing, the benches. You have a hard drive, things like factory knowledge transfer, the decisions and changes log, the automations folder, the examples folder, the templates folder...it has boot instructions and protocols. The overall project repository, which is a superset of the factory system (i.e. the factory instantiation for a repository is embedded within the repository itself), is like the case. Then you transition interactions to me by way of the monitor--Honestly, I don't know how this part works, and I think you have a lot of questions as well. Then, the Owner/me interacts back with you using the keyboard and mouse--and again, this is the part I don't understand. How do I provide you that content/interaction.
1. I didn't clearly separate Owner and Foreman responsibilities
1. I used a traditional documentation approach rather than a task-based approach
1. I'm not sure that's even it. I think you just documented it in the same way as you've documented the rest of the factory system. And that's not what this needs to be. This needs to be a clear set of instructions for how to use the factory, how the owner and foreman interact with each other.
1. I failed to include specific examples and commands
1. I didn't properly consider the user's perspective and needs

## (1.3) 2024-12-13 Development Notes

### Major System Reorganization

#### Context

Started with improving documentation clarity and ended up completely reorganizing the system structure to better align with user mental models.

#### Key Changes

1. Metaphor Switch

   - From: Factory-based metaphor
   - To: Computer system metaphor
   - Reason: More intuitive and familiar to users

2. Directory Restructure

   - Created new structure based on computer system components
   - Preserved old content in `99_FACTORY_METAPHOR`
   - Set up migration strategy

3. Documentation Updates
   - Updated Getting Started guide
   - Added new entries to decisions log
   - Revised system component descriptions

#### New System Structure

```text
01_SYSTEM/         (core system processes)
02_MEMORY/        (active workspace)
03_APPLICATIONS/  (processing tools)
04_STORAGE/       (persistent storage)
05_MONITOR/       (system monitoring)
```

#### Next Steps

1. Content Migration

   - Review files in `99_FACTORY_METAPHOR`
   - Plan migration strategy
   - Update cross-references

2. Documentation

   - Continue updating documentation
   - Create migration guides
   - Review for consistency

3. Testing
   - Verify system functionality
   - Update test cases
   - Check all references
