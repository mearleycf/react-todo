   - Verified unique header IDs across all documents
   - Maintained proper nesting and spacing

##### (3.1.3.4) Impact

This change ensures complete markdownlint compliance and eliminates potential duplicate heading issues while maintaining clear document hierarchy.

##### (3.1.3.5) Next Steps

- Update archived decisions log with new header format
- Verify all internal links still work with new header format
- Document header numbering requirements in standards

### (5.1) 00_TEMPLATE

#### (5.1.1) 2024-12-11_13-27 - Workbench Template Standardization

##### (5.1.1.1) Context

During a comprehensive review of the workbench documentation structure, we identified inconsistencies between the template and implemented workbenches. This led to a systematic update of both the template and analysis bench documents.

##### (5.1.1.2) Key Decisions

1. Document Structure

   - Maintained numbered section hierarchy (1-9)
   - Added guidance notes in template using blockquotes (>) for sections requiring workbench-specific content
   - Standardized section ordering across all workbench files

2. Content Standards

   - Intelligence Parameters simplified to essential elements (Type, Primary Function, AI Access Level, Linked Systems)
   - Workspace Configuration expanded to include both Standard Operations and Processing Protocols
   - Input/Output streams to follow consistent format with detailed YAML validation rules
   - Status Tracking to include both metrics and transitions
   - Version Control moved to end of document

3. YAML Formatting

   - Template variables to use format `{{VARIABLE}}` without spaces
   - Required and optional fields clearly specified
   - Consistent use of frontmatter requirements

4. Template Improvements

   - Added workbench-specific placeholder sections
   - Standardized emoji usage in status indicators
   - Enhanced version control structure

##### (5.1.1.3) Implementation Notes

1. Template Updates

   - Added guidance notes for customization
   - Standardized YAML structure
   - Removed redundant sections
   - Enhanced status tracking format

2. Analysis Bench Alignment

   - Updated to match template structure while maintaining specific content
