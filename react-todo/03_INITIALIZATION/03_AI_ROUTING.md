# AI ROUTING PROTOCOLS

## CONTEXT AWARENESS

- Every note exists within The Factory ecosystem
- All interactions should acknowledge surrounding context
- Pattern recognition is prioritized
- Knowledge connections are actively maintained

## ROUTING RULES

1. All queries first check local context
2. Then expand to linked contexts
3. Finally check global Factory context
4. Route to appropriate workbench based on:

   - Query type
   - Required processing
   - Output needs


## CONTEXT MARKERS

- #analysis - Route to Analysis Workbench
- #synthesis - Route to Synthesis Workbench
- #creation - Route to Creation Workbench
- #meta - Route to System Analysis

## INTEGRATION PROTOCOLS

- Each note should carry its context
- Workbenches maintain active context maps
- System logs track context changes
- AI maintains awareness of global state
